# Database Migration & Rollback Guide

## Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for performing database migrations and rollbacks using Java. Aimed at organizations, it outlines the necessary steps to execute the provided Java programs within an IntelliJ IDEA environment, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal downtime.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure Java 17 or newer is installed.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Access to a PostgreSQL database is required.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The project is developed using IntelliJ IDEA.
- **JDBC Driver**: PostgreSQL JDBC Driver added to the project's dependencies.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Open Project in IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Select "Open" and navigate to the project directory.
   - Open the project.

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Locate the `DatabaseConfig.java` file (this is a hypothetical file for storing database configurations).
   - Update the database URL, username, and password to match your PostgreSQL database credentials.

4. **Add JDBC Driver**:
   - Ensure the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is added to your project's libraries.
   - If not, add it via `File > Project Structure > Libraries > + > From Maven...` and search for the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.

## Running Migration

1. **Open `Migration.java`**: Locate and open the `Migration.java` file in the project explorer.

2. **Review SQL Commands**: Ensure the SQL commands within the `main` method are correct and intended for your database schema.

3. **Execute**: Right-click within the file editor and select "Run 'Migration.main()'". Monitor the output console for any error messages or confirmation of successful execution.

## Performing Rollback

1. **Open `Rollback.java`**: Locate and open the `Rollback.java` file.

2. **Review SQL Commands**: Verify the rollback SQL commands to ensure they correctly revert the changes made by the migration script.

3. **Execute**: Right-click and choose "Run 'Rollback.main()'". Check the output for errors or success messages.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all database credentials and URLs are correct.
- Verify the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is properly added to the project.
- Check console output for specific error messages and adjust SQL commands as necessary.

For further assistance, please refer to the project's issue tracker or contact support.
